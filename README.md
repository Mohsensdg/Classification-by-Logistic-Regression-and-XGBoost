# Classification-by-Logistic-Regression-and-XGBoost
A dataset of car insurance customers (from Kaggle) was explored while deploying logistic regression and XGBoost to predict costumers claiming loan.
The description of dataset is as below:

The company has shared its annual car insurance data. Now, you have to find out the real customer behaviors over the data. he columns are resembling practical world features. The outcome column indicates 1 if a customer has claimed his/her loan else 0. The data has 19 features from there 18 of them are corresponding logs which were taken by the company.

After conducting significant data analysis, I experimented with two classification models to see how well they performed on the dataset. With accuracy, precision, and recall score, I obtained quite decent results.

After Tuning the Hyperparameter Logistic Regression had Accuracy of 84.73% and XGBoost algorithm had Accuracy of 84.6%
